								<h1>Speech and Debate</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I started competing in Speech and Debate in eighth grade. I was naturally drawn to Platform Speaking as I could construct my own speech. For the next 5 years, I have competed in every single platform event: Declamation, Original Oratory, Informative Speaking, and Program Oral Interpretation. My main event is in Informative Speaking where I have covered a variety of topics. I am a varsity competitor where I focused on attending and excelling at 3 major tournaments: NIETOC, TOC, and Nationals. I am also a Platform coach at Golden State Academy, one of the largest competitive organizations in California and I am the president of my school's speech and debate club. Look below to see my accomplistments in this activity within my junior year of high school. </p>

												<h3>Arizona State University Invitational</h3>
											</header>
											<p> This was my first tournament for the 2023-2024 tournament season. It was held at ASU Tempe campus from 01/05/2024 - 01/07/2024. I competed in Original Oratory and Informative Speaking. I had just finished memorizing both of these speeches the day before the tournament started; thus, I was worried about my results. However, I was able to push through and make it to the final round for Informative Speaking. After all was said and done, I placed 5th out of 75 competitors in the West Coast for Informative Speaking. This placement gave me a TOC and NIETOC Bid. However, it was only the start of my tournament record.</p>

												<h3>James Logan Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This tournament was special as students could compete up to four events. Since I wanted to push myself, I entered myself in three events: Declamation, Original Oratory, and Informative Speaking. Being held at James Logan High School from 01/12/2024 - 01/12/2024, this tournament would span 2 full days from day to night. Even with the intense rainfall and the constant running around campus to make it to my rounds, I was able to push through and do well at this tournament. In Informative Speaking, I placed 4th out of 99 entries whcih got me a NIETOC and TOC bid. In Declamation, I placed 4th out of 63 entries. In Original Oratory, I placed 8th out of 119 entries. While these were good results, I knew I could do better.</p>

												<h3>Coastal Forensics League Speech 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Also known as CFL Speech 3, this tournament was held at Milpitas High School on 01/21/2024. I had to compete at this tournament to compete for the State Qualifer Tournament. I competed in both Informative Speaking and Original Oratory. Finishing the Arizona and James Logan Tournament, I was exhausted and had come under the weather. However, I wanted to show my best as I wanted to show what underdog schools were capabale of. After 4 intense rounds of speaking, I placed 1st out of 75 entries in Informative Speaking, securing me a TOC Bid. This tournament was incredible for me for 2 reasons. First, this was the first tournament I championed in my entire career. Secondly, I had finally proven to myself and other competitive schools that I was a force to be reckoned with.</p>

												<h3>California Invitational UC Berkeley</h3>
											</header>
											<p>One of the most pretigious and nationally recognized tournaments in the West Coast, the Cal Invitational was held at UC Berkeley from 02/17/2024 - 02/19/2024. While I was told not to attend this touranemnt as I did not need the bids for Informative Speaking, I really wanted to prove my skills to the rest of the S&D community. In addition, I wanted to do better than last year as I did not place well. At the end of this 3 day tournament, I placed 3rd out of 102 entires in Informative Speaking. This was a major victory for me as this tournament was a indicator of how well you do at the National level! </p>

												<h3>California High School Speech Association State Championship</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This was it! After months of preperation, I attended the biggest California tournament: The Championship. Out of the 700 competitors in Informative Speaking, only 54 qualified to the State Championship. This was held at Clovis North High School from 04/12/2024 - 04/14/2024. I was incredibly nervous for this tournament as this was my first time qualifing for this tournament. The entry pool was filled with National Finalists, previous California State Champions, and more. Every round was filled with anxiety and stress. However, after 5 rounds of facing the toughest competition I have known, I won the tournament. I was officially the California State Champion!</p>

												<h3>National Invididual Event Tournament of Champions</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Now, I entered the big leagues. The National Invididual Event Tournament, otherwise known as NIETOC, was held in Omaha, Nebraska from 05/10/2024 - 05/12/2024. I worked for the last 6 months, perfectly crafting my speech. However, 2 big challenges hindered me right before the tournament. First, I just came out of AP Psychology and had to study for my AP Calculus Exam the monday right after the tournament. Thus, I had an anxiety and worry permeating through my mind. Secondly, I had a minor throat infection which made it difficult to speak well. However, I had to persist because I wanted to see my limit. I competed in the 2 hardest speech events: Informative Speaking and Original Oratory. Within both of these events, there were 150 entries in this tournament but there were over 2000 students trying to qualify for this tournament. At tht end of this National Tournament, I placed 33rd in Original Oratory and 20th in Informative Speaking. I was extremely happy with these results as I battled multiple unexpected variables and still placed very well!</p>

												<h3>National Speech and Debate Tournament</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The biggest Tournament. Held in Des Moines, Iowa from 06/16/2024 - 06/21/2024, this tournament was the true test of one's speaker skills. I competed in Informative Speaking at this tournament. Out of the 6000 tudents doing Informative Speaking, only 262 entries qualified for this tournament. I had just came back from a Kung Fu performance and did not practice enough for this tournament. However, I took 3 days of simply revising my speech at least 30 times. After this tournament concluded, here was the result. I was 33rd out of 6000 students in Informative Speaking. I was both surprised and extremely grateful for these results. This concluded my tournament season! </p>
