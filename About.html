												<h3>An Academic</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Studies come first for me. Whether it is doing extensive research for a speech on cultural appropriation, solving differential equations, or analyzing color theories in AP Psychology, I am obsessed with my academics. I always try to put my full attention on my education and want to do well. While I do not know my major, I know I want to make an impact on my community through business ventures, AI infrastructure, or mechanical feats. Even if I have some free time, I like learning new information. Scrolling through The Guardian and The New York Times is my jam. I do not read The Onion!

												<h3>A Child</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am a child at heart. I still watch and sometimes rewatch all my childhood shows like Lab Rats, Mighty Med, KC Undercover, Ninjago, and Kung Fu Panda. If there's any kid show in the US, I have either watched it or plan to watch it. I remain child-like in many ways. I always take extreme risks just for the thrill. Sometimes, this is helpful, like when I joined some of my extracurriculars because I had the courage to do so. Other times, this risk-taking is not so helpful, like when I climbed my house and almost fell. My interactions with my family reflect my childish side. I still prank my brother at times, and we usually mess around in the back of the car during family trips. My brother and I play on our Switch almost every day when he is home from college. I am like a nine-year-old in high school, sprinting to class after the bell rings. I also ask a stupid amount of 'What If?' questions that annoy all my teachers. I am a child and happy to be one!</p>

												<h3>A Teacher</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I firmly believe in the quote, 'Those who know, do. Those who understand, teach.' I have taken it upon myself to teach whatever I truly grasp. While there is a contrast between being a child and a teacher, I have embodied both roles into one. My professional career in high school revolves around enjoyable teaching. I motivate students and teach them Kung Fu forms every week. I help students develop their speeches to inform and, more importantly, entertain audiences. I encourage aspiring engineers to learn programming and build using Legos, aspiring to be the next Jeff Bezos. I aim to make an impact on my community, and so far, I am accomplishing this goal as a teacher!</p>

												<h3>A Human</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am like any other teenager on this planet. I make mistakes, sometimes small and sometimes large. Anytime I make a mistake, I do my best to address the issue and try to fix it. However, I have learned that time is the best healer for all problems. I am still confused about many topics in my life, like the International Economy or Quantum Computing. Every day, I try to learn something new. I am sometimes angry with myself and the world, but I have learned how to control it. I am grateful for all the opportunities that my family has given me. I am happy when the little things fall into place. This is who I am: Human!</p>
