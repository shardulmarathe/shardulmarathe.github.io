												<h3>An Academic</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Studies comes first for me. Whether it is doing extensive research for a speech on cultural appropriation, solving differential equations, or analyzing color theories in AP Psychology, I am obessed with my academics. I always try to put my full attention in my education and want to do well. While I do not know my major, I know I want to make an impact on my community through business ventures, AI infrastructure, or mechanical feats. Even if I have some free time, I like learning new information. Scrolling through the The Guardian and the New York Times is my jam. I do not read the Onion!!</p>

												<h3>A Child</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am a child at heart. I still watch and sometimes rewatch all my childhood shows. Lab Rats, Mighty Med, KC Undercover, Ninjago, Kung Fu Panda. If there is any kid show in the US, I have eithered watched it or plan to watch it. I am still child-like in many ways. I always take extreme risks just for the thrill. Sometimes, this is helpful when I joined some of my extracurriculars as I had the courage to do join it. Other times, this risk-taking is not so helpful like when I am climbing my house and almost fall. My interactions with my family is me being a kid. I still prank my brother at times and we are usually messing around in the back of the car during family trips. My brother and I play on our switch almost every day when he is home for college. I am nine year old in high school as I sprint to class after the bell rings. I also ask a stupid amount of What If? questions that annoy all my teachers. I am a child and happy to be one!</p>

												<h3>A Teacher</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am in the firm believer of this quote "Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach." I have took upon myself to teach whatever it is I truly grasp. While there is a contrast between a child and a teacher, I have embodied both of them into one. My professional career in high school revolves around fun teaching. I movitate students and slowly teach them Kung Fu forms every week. I help student develop their speeches to inform and more importantly, entertain an audience. I encourage aspiring engineers to learn about programming and building using legos so that they can be the next Jeff Bezos. I wanted to make an impact on my community; so far, I am accomplishing this goal as a teacher!</p>

												<h3>A Human</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I am like any other teenager on this planet. I make mistakes, sometimes small and sometimes large. Anytime I mistake, I do my best to address the issue and try to fix it. However, I have learned that time is the best healer for all problems. I am still confused on many topics in my life like the International Economy or Quantum Computing. Everyday, I try to learn something new. I am sometimes angry with myself and the world but I have learned how to control it. I am grateful for all the opporuntities that my family has given me. I am happy when the little things fall into place. This is who I am: Human!</p>
