												<h3>Throw / Catch</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The throw and catch was the first trick I learned and, by far, the hardest trick. The learning curve from beginner to throw/catch is steep. However, after hundreds of tries and multiple failures, I was able to place my diabolo on the string, get it spinning, unloop it, and throw it high into the air. Whether it is 5 feet or 50 feet in the air, I am able to catch a diabolo from any height!</p>

												<h3>Around the Leg</h3>
											</header>
											<p>"Around the Leg" was an easy trick to master. I learned how to balance on one leg while performing other actions through Kung Fu. However, it still took a month to fully master it, as I needed to ensure the strings were positioned directly under the Diabolo each time. Since I was going around my leg, my vision was limited. Regardless, I could launch my Diabolo around my leg and catch it. This simple trick inspired new tricks, like partner leg catches, where two partners throw the Diabolo around their legs to each other!

												<h3>Around the Arm</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Just like the leg trick, this trick did not require much effort to learn. However, I had to be very careful with this trick, as one wrong move could make me headless. After about two months of training and working on this trick, I eventually got it!

												<h3>Suns</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This is my favorite trick out of everything I have learned in Diabolo. By placing both sticks in one hand, I can rotate my wrist, creating a ring-shaped motion for the Diabolo to follow. I used this trick and combined it with my Kung Fu experience to perform a Chainwhip-inspired Diabolo routine. This was the first time I realized I could combine Kung Fu and Diabolo into one!

												<h3>Vertax</h3>
											</header>
											<p>One of the hardest tricks to learn, the Vertex, required me to change my perception of how the diabolo works. I had to rotate the diabolo on its axis so that its cups were facing downward. This alone required one month of practice. After this step, I had to push my hand forward and backward to continue generating spin. Changing the diabolo into the Vertex position required five months of training, yet it was well worth it. Now, I have entirely new tricks I can learn, and I can start incorporating new Kung Fu styles into it!

												<h3>Around the Head</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Moving a Diabolo around your head is incredibly dangerous. In my journey to merge Kung Fu and Diabolo, I wanted to learn how to do a neck whip using my Diabolo. However, one wrong step could result in me losing my head or injuring my legs. I spent around eight months practicing this movement, progressing from using the sticks themselves to eventually moving with the Diabolo. I injured myself multiple times and even broke my glasses twice performing this stunt. But it was an amazing experience and another example of how good skills take time to hone. In the end, it was worth it, as many people praised me for this trick!

												<h3>MSJHS Multicultural Performance</h3>
											</header>
											<p>While I was learning new skills with the Diabolo, I was asked by the MC leaders to perform in the MSJHS Multicultural performance. I immediately jumped at this opportunity as I could take everything I had learned in Diabolo and show it off to others. After 2 months of practice, I demonstrated my skills and received a huge round of applause for my efforts. In addition to my success, I also learned more about Chinese culture through the Diabolo. It's not just called the Chinese Yo-Yo or Diabolo; it is Kong Zhong, which means "Up in the Air." My journey with the Chinese Yo-Yo helped me both culturally and mentally!
