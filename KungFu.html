								<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Since I was 5 years old, I have been deeply interested in martial arts. From 3rd grade to 8th grade, I practiced Karate at West Coast Martial Arts, where I achieved a Red Belt at the second degree. Due to COVID-19, the karate studio shut down. Fortunately, I found another dojo that was more fulfilling than the previous one: Dragon Rhythm Shaolin Kung Fu. From 8th grade until now, I have been training for almost 5-8 hours per week, focusing on my flexibility, strength, forms, and more. Learning the art of Kung Fu hasn't been an easy journey, but it has been one of the most rewarding paths I have taken in my life.

												<h3>1st Degree Black Belt</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After training for over three years and advancing through each belt level quickly, I achieved my first-degree black belt on December 11, 2022. During the belt test, I performed the Whipchain and Staff traditional forms to pass. I also showcased a variety of jumping skills such as jump front kicks, headflips, and more. Throughout my Kung Fu journey, I had to learn an entirely new martial arts style, and I am excited to see where this activity takes me!											</p>

												<h3>2nd Degree Black Belt</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After my first degree test, I wanted to advance further and push myself. Over six months of training, I dedicated approximately 12-14 hours per week. On May 17th, 2023, I successfully tested for my 2nd degree black belt. This belt test was special for several reasons. Firstly, I performed more challenging variations of jumping skills, which are uncommon at my Kung Fu studio. For instance, I executed a one-legged tornado kick and a no-hand kip up. Secondly, I achieved the highest score in my division during the belt test. Thirdly, being able to test alongside all my friends was an amazing feeling!

												<h3>2024 Golden State International Wushu Championships</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When my Kung Fu Master asked me to join the team and attend this international competition, I was apprehensive because I lacked experience with Kung Fu competitions. However, after his constant encouragement and positive feedback, I decided to participate. I competed in three forms: Double Daggers, Pudao, and Dahuan Fist. Despite fierce competition from participants who had practiced Kung Fu for over 12 years in my age group, I managed to secure first place in Double Daggers, second place in Dahuan Fist, and third place in Pudao. I am thrilled with these results, considering the intense difficulty of the competition at the international level!</p>

												<h3>China Shaolin Temple Performance</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My Kung Fu Studio was invited to China to perform at various schools. Since I was one of their top students, I was asked to join this trip and be a representative of the school. Honored by the invitation, I accepted and flew to China to perform in front of Olympic Wushu athletes and Shaolin monks. The most notable performance was in front of Abbot Shi Yongxin. He praised us for our performance and was impressed by my mastery of Kung Fu despite being an international student. In addition to these performances, I also embraced Chinese culture through its food, acrobatic performances, and landmarks.</p>

I have spent the last 2 years teaching students from white belts all the way up to black belts. I am now an Eagle Level Assistant, nearing the status of a true master of the studio!											</p>
