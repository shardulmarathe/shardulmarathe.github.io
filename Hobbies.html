												<h3>Chess</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I have been playing chess ever since I was in 2nd grade. During my middle school years, I competed competitively and reached a max ELO of 1500. However, my time got split between other activites and I decided to play this game recreationally. If you see me on my phone, I am not texting people. I either solving puzzles to beat my max streak of 25, winning at bullet chess, or thrashing my brother!</p>

												<h3>Table Tennis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When I started playing table tennis, I thought it would be my sport. I loved moving around the table, learning about different spins used in the game, and smashing the ping pong ball onto the table. Eventually, I adjusted and did this sport for fun as I wanted to continue further with Kung Fu. I currently have a Table Tennis Table in backyard where I play with friends and family!</p>

												<h3>Cooking</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Like many individuals during COVID-19, I took up cooking and baking as a way to pass the time. Originally as an excuse to make cakes and other sweet-infused treats, I realized the beauty of baking. Seeing how all the ingredients merge together to form delectable items, I started to learn new recipes and experimenting with other flavors. Every week, I usually make quesdillas with my brother and make a brithday cake for my family. Right now, I am working on perfecting my macarons!</p>

												<h3>Coding</h3>
											</header>
											<p>One of my favorite hobbies has to be coding. My brother encouraged me to code when I was in 4th grade as he said it would be a worthwhile subject. When I first approached coding, I thought of it as something you could memorize and then become good at. Sadly, I was mistaken. I have spent the last 8 years learning how to code in various languages like Python, Java, HTML, and more. I actually coded this website using HTML. However, I still have a long way to learn before becoming a coding expert. I took an introduction to ML and expeirmented with OpenCV for robotics. I really want to learn more about this area as it seems fascinating. PS: The snippet seen in the image is actually from the creation of this website!!</p>
